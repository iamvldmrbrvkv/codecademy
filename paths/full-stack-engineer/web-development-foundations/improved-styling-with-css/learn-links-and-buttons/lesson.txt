browser link styles
Web browsers have always taken account of the importance of using signifiers for navigation. 
By default, browsers include a user agent stylesheet, a set of default styles included with the browser (“user agent”) for use on all web pages. 
The HTML5 specification defines a set of default behavior for rendering content. 
These styles are used to ensure that a raw HTML file is styled to be reasonably readable by any user, and user agent stylesheets include styling for headings, tables, links, and more basic HTML elements. 
Most users do not see these styles too often, because designers override them with their own custom designs. 
However, it’s important to note that maintaining a consistent user experience pattern, like the default behavior applied by browsers, is important for creating a consistent experience.

Traditionally, links are differentiated from regular text using blue text and underlines to draw users’ attention to their clickability. 
Many websites and user agent stylesheets still use these link styles.

Browsers also style two other link states: clicked (‘active’), and previously visited. 
In most user agent stylesheets, clicked (but not yet followed) links appear with red text, and previously visited links are styled with purple text.

link styling
Anchor text, the text itself of a link, should be descriptive of the linked resource. 
Although this is not strictly a design problem, it is important for usability, accessibility, and SEO. 
For example, the link at the beginning of this paragraph would be much more difficult to parse with a screen reader if it were re-written as follows:
Text for links, known as anchor text, should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">descriptive</a>.

tooltips and titles
Additional context can be provided as text using the HTML title attribute. 
Although the title attribute can be provided to any HTML element, it is often extremely useful as additional context or advisory text for clickable elements.

Most browsers will display the text of a title attribute as a tooltip, meaning when a user hovers their cursor over an element, the text will appear in a small box near the cursor.

To add tooltips to a clickable element like a link, add it as the title attribute.

NOTE: The title attribute is HTML’s built-in way of creating tooltips, but is known to cause a variety of accessibility issues. 
Developers have come up with a number of ways to create tooltips that are more accessible, but this generally requires using CSS and JavaScript, which fall out of the scope of this lesson. 
When creating tooltips in the wild, you should research ways to make them accessible for everyone.

hover states and cursors
The CSS pseudo-class :hover can be used to style elements on mouse hover. 
For instance, to change the color of link anchor text from blue to orange when a user hovers over it, the following CSS could be used:

a {
  color: blue;
}
 
a:hover {
  color: orange;
}
The first rule sets link colors to blue by default, and when a user mouses over a link, the second rule will override the color attribute of the <a> tag and cause the text to turn orange. 
When the user moves the cursor away from the link, the text color will revert to blue.

In addition to any text style changes when hovering over a link, the user’s cursor should change from the default appearance to a pointing hand. 
The CSS cursor property is used to control this behavior. 
For example, to add this behavior to all <a> tags, the following rule could be used:

a {
  cursor: pointer;
}
Luckily, this behavior is generally included in browser user agent stylesheets, and it also exists in the HTML5 default styles.

Hover state styling should never be used as the sole indication that something is a link. 
Users should not be forced to move their mouse over an entire document to tell what might be clickable. 
Additionally, hover states are not accessible in mobile browsers. 
Mobile devices do not generally have on-screen cursors, and users must actually touch the device (and possibly trigger a click event) to interact.

link states
Links have four main states: normal (not clicked), hover, active (clicked), and visited. 
These four states have associated CSS pseudo-classes: :link, :hover, :active, and :visited. 
These four states can be used to give a full range of visual feedback to users about the status of their link interaction.

Each state should still make it clear that the element in question is a link, meaning it should not make text identical to non-link text or alter the link’s appearance so much that users could perceive its behavior differently.

The ordering of link state pseudo-class rules is important to reveal the proper information. 
When a user hovers and then clicks a link, those styles should always override the static styling surrounding a user’s history with the link (unvisited :link and :visited). 
The proper order of these rules is:

:link
:visited
:hover
:active
This ordering will ensure that the rules cascade properly and the user can receive the most applicable visual feedback about the state of the link.

skeuomorphism and flat design
In design, skeuomorphism is helpful for lowering the learning curve for users. 
If users can draw a metaphor between a familiar real-life object and an interface element, they are more likely to know how to use it without training. 
In the example of the button, if a web button appears similar to a real-life button on a physical interface, users can reliably figure out that the way to interact with the button is to press it.

Flat design is an alternative approach to skeuomorphism that embraces the fact that computer interfaces do not necessarily need to model real-life interfaces. 
As users grow more familiar with digital displays and interfaces, designers have felt less need to model physical interactions and instead rely on other signifiers to indicate interactive elements. 
To generalize, flat design uses simplicity and lack of clutter for its UI elements.

Note: We will be using the HTML <button> element to create these designs. 
<button>s come with some default styles, such as a border and background-color, which give them a built-in “buttony” look. 
In this exercise and the exercises that follow, you will use CSS to create customized buttons that override these defaults. 
To learn more about the HTML <button>, you can visit the MDN Web Docs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button.

buttons: skeuomorphic styling
Skeuomorphic button design aims to imitate the appearance and interactivity of a real-life button, often including a ‘raised’ appearance while the button is unpressed and a ‘pressed’ appearance when clicked.

Skeuomorphic button design can be implemented using image files, CSS rules, or a combination of both. 
CSS styles should be preferred over image files if possible, since they are faster to load, have smaller file sizes, and allow for a more consistent scaling and appearance across different screen sizes and resolutions. 
Modern CSS3 has support for many 2-D and 3-D effects and animations and can create many skeuomorphic button designs on its own.

If using CSS rules, the use of hover and/or active states is important in order to model interaction with a real button. 
For example, to implement a bare minimum 3-D button design, the following CSS ruleset could be used:

button {
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  text-decoration: none;
  box-shadow: 0px 5px;
}
 
button:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
 
button:active {
  margin-top: 5px;
  color: black;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px;
}
A button element can then be created with the following HTML:

<button>Click me</button>
The default state of this <button> has some basic ‘buttony’ appearance with a rounded border (border and border-radius properties) and a slightly raised appearance with the use of the box-shadow. 
The :hover cursor is added for visual feedback. 
When the button is clicked (:active), the box-shadow is removed, and the margin-top moves the button down by 5px, making it appear to be pressed.

The above example is only one very basic implementation of a 3-D button; there are many additional (and more attractive) ways to create skeuomorphic buttons.

.question-link:visited {
  color: #ffffff;
}

a, .answer {
  cursor: pointer;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:link {
  color: #61bff9;
}

a:visited, .answer {
  color: #466995;
}

a:hover, .answer:hover { 
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:active, .answer:active {
  color: #ffffff;
  margin-top: 24px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px;
  background-color: #C0D6DF;
}

.answer {
  border: 1px solid #466995;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px;
}

buttons: flat design
Flat design is so-called because of its 2-D appearance. 
Elements appear flat on the screen, and designers must rely on other styling and signifiers to indicate clickability.

Flat design buttons commonly appear as rectangles, rounded rectangles, or circles. 
These shapes are used ubiquitously for button elements, so users often perceive them as buttons and expect them to be clickable.

Since there are fewer obvious signifiers surrounding buttons in a flat design, they should be visually distinct from other page elements.

In flat designs in particular, button text is very important for clarity—the possibility of user confusion is reduced by pairing buttons with specific, descriptive labels. 
A button with ‘Click here’ leaves many more open questions than a button that reads ‘Submit form’.

.question-link:visited {
  color: #ffffff;
}

a {
  cursor: pointer;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:link {
  color: #61bff9;
}

a:visited, .answer {
  color: #466995;
}

a:hover { 
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:active, .answer:active {
  color: #ffffff;
  background-color: #C0D6DF;
}

.answer {
  border: 1px solid #466995;
}

buttons: hover states
Just as with links, buttons should make use of hover states and the cursor: pointer declaration. 
All the caveats about the shortcomings of hover states on mobile devices apply to buttons, but their use is still encouraged.

Users expect buttons to be clickable. 
Since buttons can consist of any number of total elements (rectangular/circular body, text, image(s)), all elements should be clickable, should display their clickability, and should result in the same behavior.

.question-link:visited {
  color: #ffffff;
}

a {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a, .answer {
  cursor: pointer;
}

a:link {
  color: #61bff9;
}

a:visited, .answer {
  color: #466995;
}

a:hover { 
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:active, .answer:active {
  color: #DBE9EE;
}

.answer {
  border: 1px solid #466995;
}

.answer:hover {
  background-color: #C0D6DF;
}

.answer:active {
  color: #ffffff;
}

review
Added styles to make links recognizable and distinguishable from ordinary text.
Added link styles that depend upon mouse interaction state, providing users with visual feedback for cursor hovering and mouse clicks.
Added additional context text with the HTML title attribute.
Styled buttons to be easily recognizable (in both skeuomorphic and flat design styles) using box shapes, border, hover, and active states.
Remember that the styles that you implemented here are only one of countless ways to communicate clickability and provide users with visual feedback. 
There is a huge amount of opportunity for variety and creativity while still following best practices and common user experience patterns.
