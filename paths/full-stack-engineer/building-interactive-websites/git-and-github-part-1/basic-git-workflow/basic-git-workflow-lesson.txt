Generalizations
You have now been introduced to the fundamental Git workflow. You learned a lot! Letâ€™s take a moment to generalize:

Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers
Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
git init creates a new Git repository
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log shows a list of all previous commits
