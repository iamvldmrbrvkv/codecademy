What is the GitHub Community?
Learn more about the Github community and how to interact with open source projects!

What Makes a GitHub community?
GitHub on its own is starting to become a kind of internet community of its own, almost like a social media site for software engineers. Displaying and sharing code is easy. Users can create profiles to save interesting codebases, follow other users, and host their code. We‚Äôll discuss how to round out a GitHub profile and how to be engaged in all that the community has to offer!

Github Profiles
With GitHub profiles, users can follow other users and see what they work on in their careers. A well-rounded GitHub profile will not only look good to recruiters but boost reputability when we want to make contributions to open source projects.

A good GitHub profile will have several different projects, ideally with different concepts driving each project. Each project should have a well-written README document. This shows that the user can communicate their work with other developers through good code documentation.

A diagram imitation of a GitHub profile, which includes the user photo, different projects stored in different repositories called Code Art, JavaScript Tools, and Personal Website. At the bottom, there is a contribution counter to show how often the user works on their code.
Another thing that suggests a well-rounded GitHub profile would be a filled-out activity tracker that displays how many contributions the user makes daily, whether to their own projects or community ones.

Multiple choice
What is the most complete description of GitHub as a platform?


GitHub lets software engineers build resume portfolios online.


GitHub keeps code hosted privately in a totally remote location.

(Selected)Correct:
It allows for code and knowledge to be easily shared and built upon between people in a community of technologists and developers.


GitHub is a large database of different code for people to view a hundred years later.

üëè
Correct! Github is primarily used for the sharing of code.
Multiple choice
What goes into creating a good Github profile?


Changing the profile picture from the default.


Having one, really good project.

(Selected)Correct:
Creating several, well-written projects with good README documents.


Having all my contact information available.

üëè
Correct. Several, well-written projects with strong contributions along with a history of active contributions help your Github profile suggest you are an experienced developer.
Exploring Code on GitHub
A great way to find inspiration for your projects is to use GitHub‚Äôs search feature. You can search for specific companies, developers, and even projects. For instance, you can easily search for projects relating to a Discord chatbot and then choose the target language, like C#. If you want to contribute to a Discord bot built-in C# or grab some code to get yourself started on a chatbot, you can!

Another great place to look for projects pertaining to certain topics is the GitHub Topics page https://github.com/topics. Here, projects are grouped by topics like Arduino projects and algorithms.

Even if you don‚Äôt know what to look for, GitHub Explore https://github.com/explore will use existing projects in your GitHub profile to automatically find other projects you might be interested in. And, to see what other developers are currently interested in, you can check out what‚Äôs trending https://github.com/trending in the GitHub community!

The image shows GitHub's trending page, full of recent popular projects from around the world.
Multiple choice
Which of the following about GitHub profiles is untrue?


GitHub profiles display some important stats about how often you contribute and which projects you‚Äôve worked on.


Creating well-written README‚Äòs in each project makes your GitHub profile look better.

(Selected)Correct:
To make a GitHub profile stand out, you only have to worry about making sure you contribute to your code often enough.

üëè
Yes, this is incorrect! Along with contributing to your code, you want to have a diverse set of projects each with well-written documentation in the form of README‚Äôs.
Open Source Projects On GitHub
Open source projects have their code open to the public and usually take code submissions from the developer community. For instance, NASA, Facebook, and Google all use GitHub for open-source projects. That means developers outside of those organizations volunteer to help with bug fixes and experiment on new features.

While a company or developer might not want all of their projects to be open source, many big companies maintain open-source projects to stay in touch with the wider developer community and generate user interest. Google has many repositories where the broader community collaborates:

Google's almost 2000 open repositories. At the top of the Google organization's page, the description says Google hearts Open Source.
Another example is Facebook has a repository named Folly https://github.com/facebook/folly which is used internally and has over 10,000 commits from developers from all over the world. That means that anyone who has made a commit to Folly can technically say they‚Äôve helped add on to a project being used by Facebook.

Making contributions to open-source projects is a great way to grow your skill and experience. To contribute, you can start at any repository‚Äôs issues page, where bugs and potential new features are listed. Then, you can fork the repository to work on a specific issue and eventually make a pull request.

You can take a look at these current open discussions in the Folly repository https://github.com/facebook/folly/issues.

Multiple choice
What does it mean for a project to be open source?


Nothing. Open-source is just a buzz word in the industry.


Anyone can ask the developer questions about the software since they wrote it.

(Selected)Correct:
Anyone can access the code and modify it through a vetted process.


The source code can be downloaded by anyone, but not everyone can modify it.

üëè
Correct! Open source projects can be seen by anyone, with anyone being able to suggest changes to the collaborators.
Now that you know more about the GitHub community, feel free to start building up your profile by creating your own projects! You can also start exploring GitHub for other projects that you can fork or star. As you gain more experience, start looking at issues in projects and start fixing them!
