Making an async POST Request

1. At the top of main.js, assign apiKey to your Rebrandly API key.

2. The fetch() function should be inside the try{} statement, which should be inside the shortenUrl() function. In the fetch() function, pass in url as the first argument and an empty object as the second argument.

In that empty object you just created, add the following three properties:

method with a value of 'POST'
body with a value of data
headers with a value of the object below:
{
  'Content-type': 'application/json',
  'apikey': apiKey
}
Run the code. Then paste in the URL again and click the shorten button.

Great job using Rebrandly to shorten your URL!
