Introduction
Often in web development, we need to handle asynchronous actions— actions we can wait on while moving on to other tasks. We make requests to networks, databases, or any number of similar operations. JavaScript is non-blocking: instead of stopping the execution of code while it waits, JavaScript uses an event-loop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ which allows it to efficiently execute other tasks while it awaits the completion of these asynchronous actions.

Originally, JavaScript used callback functions to handle asynchronous actions. The problem with callbacks is that they encourage complexly nested code which quickly becomes difficult to read, debug, and scale. With ES6, JavaScript integrated native promises https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise which allow us to write significantly more readable code. JavaScript is continually improving, and ES8 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#8th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2017 provides a new syntax for handling our asynchronous action, async...await. The async...await syntax allows us to write asynchronous code that reads similarly to traditional synchronous, imperative programs.

The async...await syntax is syntactic sugar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar— it doesn’t introduce new functionality into the language, but rather introduces a new syntax for using promises and generators https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator. Both of these were already built in to the language. Despite this, async...await powerfully improves the readability and scalability of our code. Let’s learn how to use it!

The async Keyword
The async keyword is used to write functions that handle asynchronous actions. We wrap our asynchronous logic inside a function prepended with the async keyword. Then, we invoke that function.

async function myFunc() {
  // Function body here
};
 
myFunc();
We’ll be using async function declarations throughout this lesson, but we can also create async function expressions:

const myFunc = async () => {
  // Function body here
};
 
myFunc();
async functions always return a promise. This means we can use traditional promise syntax, like .then() and .catch with our async functions. An async function will return in one of three ways:

If there’s nothing returned from the function, it will return a promise with a resolved value of undefined.
If there’s a non-promise value returned from the function, it will return a promise resolved to that value.
If a promise is returned from the function, it will simply return that promise
async function fivePromise() { 
  return 5;
}
 
fivePromise()
.then(resolvedValue => {
    console.log(resolvedValue);
  })  // Prints 5
In the example above, even though we return 5 inside the function body, what’s actually returned when we invoke fivePromise() is a promise with a resolved value of 5.

Let’s write an async function!

The await Operator
In the last exercise, we covered the async keyword. By itself, it doesn’t do much; async functions are almost always used with the additional keyword await inside the function body.

The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. await is an operator: it returns the resolved value of a promise. Since promises resolve in an indeterminate amount of time, await halts, or pauses, the execution of our async function until a given promise is resolved.

In most situations, we’re dealing with promises that were returned from functions. Generally, these functions are through a library, and, in this lesson, we’ll be providing them. We can await the resolution of the promise it returns inside an async function. In the example below, myPromise() is a function that returns a promise which will resolve to the string "I am resolved now!".

async function asyncFuncExample(){
  let resolvedValue = await myPromise();
  console.log(resolvedValue);
}
 
asyncFuncExample(); // Prints: I am resolved now!
Within our async function, asyncFuncExample(), we use await to halt our execution until myPromise() is resolved and assign its resolved value to the variable resolvedValue. Then we log resolvedValue to the console. We’re able to handle the logic for a promise in a way that reads like synchronous code.

Writing async Functions
We’ve seen that the await keyword halts the execution of an async function until a promise is no longer pending. Don’t forget the await keyword! It may seem obvious, but this can be a tricky mistake to catch because our function will still run— it just won’t have the desired results.

We’re going to explore this using the following function, which returns a promise that resolves to 'Yay, I resolved!' after a 1 second delay:

let myPromise = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Yay, I resolved!')
    }, 1000);
  });
}
Now we’ll write two async functions which invoke myPromise():

async function noAwait() {
 let value = myPromise();
 console.log(value);
}
 
async function yesAwait() {
 let value = await myPromise();
 console.log(value);
}
 
noAwait(); // Prints: Promise { <pending> }
yesAwait(); // Prints: Yay, I resolved!
In the first async function, noAwait(), we left off the await keyword before myPromise(). In the second, yesAwait(), we included it. The noAwait() function logs Promise { <pending> } to the console. Without the await keyword, the function execution wasn’t paused. The console.log() on the following line was executed before the promise had resolved.

Remember that the await operator returns the resolved value of a promise. When used properly in yesAwait(), the variable value was assigned the resolved value of the myPromise() promise, whereas in noAwait(), value was assigned the promise object itself.

Handling Dependent Promises
The true beauty of async...await is when we have a series of asynchronous actions which depend on one another. For example, we may make a network request based on a query to a database. In that case, we would need to wait to make the network request until we had the results from the database. With native promise syntax, we use a chain of .then() functions making sure to return correctly each one:

function nativePromiseVersion() {
  returnsFirstPromise()
    .then((firstValue) => {
      console.log(firstValue);
      return returnsSecondPromise(firstValue);
    })
   .then((secondValue) => {
      console.log(secondValue);
    });
}
Let’s break down what’s happening in the nativePromiseVersion() function:

Within our function we use two functions which return promises: returnsFirstPromise() and returnsSecondPromise().
We invoke returnsFirstPromise() and ensure that the first promise resolved by using .then().
In the callback of our first .then(), we log the resolved value of the first promise, firstValue, and then return returnsSecondPromise(firstValue).
We use another .then() to print the second promise’s resolved value to the console.
Here’s how we’d write an async function to accomplish the same thing:

async function asyncAwaitVersion() {
  let firstValue = await returnsFirstPromise();
  console.log(firstValue);
  let secondValue = await returnsSecondPromise(firstValue);
  console.log(secondValue);
}
Let’s break down what’s happening in our asyncAwaitVersion() function:

We mark our function as async.
Inside our function, we create a variable firstValue assigned await returnsFirstPromise(). This means firstValue is assigned the resolved value of the awaited promise.
Next, we log firstValue to the console.
Then, we create a variable secondValue assigned to await returnsSecondPromise(firstValue). Therefore, secondValue is assigned this promise’s resolved value.
Finally, we log secondValue to the console.
Though using the async...await syntax can save us some typing, the length reduction isn’t the main point. Given the two versions of the function, the async...await version more closely resembles synchronous code, which helps developers maintain and debug their code. The async...await syntax also makes it easy to store and refer to resolved values from promises further back in our chain which is a much more difficult task with native promise syntax. Let’s create some async functions with multiple await statements!

Handling Errors
When .catch() is used with a long promise chain, there is no indication of where in the chain the error was thrown. This can make debugging challenging.

With async...await, we use try...catch statements for error handling. By using this syntax, not only are we able to handle errors in the same way we do with synchronous code, but we can also catch both synchronous and asynchronous errors. This makes for easier debugging!

async function usingTryCatch() {
 try {
   let resolveValue = await asyncFunction('thing that will fail');
   let secondValue = await secondAsyncFunction(resolveValue);
 } catch (err) {
   // Catches any errors in the try block
   console.log(err);
 }
}
 
usingTryCatch();
Remember, since async functions return promises we can still use native promise’s .catch() with an async function

async function usingPromiseCatch() {
   let resolveValue = await asyncFunction('thing that will fail');
}
 
let rejectedPromise = usingPromiseCatch();
rejectedPromise.catch((rejectValue) => {
console.log(rejectValue);
})
This is sometimes used in the global scope to catch final errors in complex code.

Handling Independent Promises
Remember that await halts the execution of our async function. This allows us to conveniently write synchronous-style code to handle dependent promises. But what if our async function contains multiple promises which are not dependent on the results of one another to execute?

async function waiting() {
 const firstValue = await firstAsyncThing();
 const secondValue = await secondAsyncThing();
 console.log(firstValue, secondValue);
}
 
async function concurrent() {
 const firstPromise = firstAsyncThing();
 const secondPromise = secondAsyncThing();
console.log(await firstPromise, await secondPromise);
}
In the waiting() function, we pause our function until the first promise resolves, then we construct the second promise. Once that resolves, we print both resolved values to the console.

In our concurrent() function, both promises are constructed without using await. We then await each of their resolutions to print them to the console.

With our concurrent() function both promises’ asynchronous operations can be run simultaneously. If possible, we want to get started on each asynchronous operation as soon as possible! Within our async functions we should still take advantage of concurrency, the ability to perform asynchronous actions at the same time.

Note: if we have multiple truly independent promises that we would like to execute fully in parallel, we must use individual .then() functions and avoid halting our execution with await.

Await Promise.all()
Another way to take advantage of concurrency when we have multiple promises which can be executed simultaneously is to await a Promise.all().

We can pass an array of promises as the argument to Promise.all(), and it will return a single promise. This promise will resolve when all of the promises in the argument array have resolved. This promise’s resolve value will be an array containing the resolved values of each promise from the argument array.

async function asyncPromAll() {
  const resultArray = await Promise.all([asyncTask1(), asyncTask2(), asyncTask3(), asyncTask4()]);
  for (let i = 0; i<resultArray.length; i++){
    console.log(resultArray[i]); 
  }
}
In our above example, we await the resolution of a Promise.all(). This Promise.all() was invoked with an argument array containing four promises (returned from required-in functions). Next, we loop through our resultArray, and log each item to the console. The first element in resultArray is the resolved value of the asyncTask1() promise, the second is the value of the asyncTask2() promise, and so on.

Promise.all() allows us to take advantage of asynchronicity— each of the four asynchronous tasks can process concurrently. Promise.all() also has the benefit of failing fast, meaning it won’t wait for the rest of the asynchronous actions to complete once any one has rejected. As soon as the first promise in the array rejects, the promise returned from Promise.all() will reject with that reason. As it was when working with native promises, Promise.all() is a good choice if multiple asynchronous tasks are all required, but none must wait for any other before executing.

Review
Awesome work getting the hang of the async...await syntax! Let’s review what you’ve learned:

async...await is syntactic sugar built on native JavaScript promises and generators.
We declare an async function with the keyword async.
Inside an async function we use the await operator to pause execution of our function until an asynchronous action completes and the awaited promise is no longer pending .
await returns the resolved value of the awaited promise.
We can write multiple await statements to produce code that reads like synchronous code.
We use try...catch statements within our async functions for error handling.
We should still take advantage of concurrency by writing async functions that allow asynchronous actions to happen in concurrently whenever possible.
