Why jQuery?
JavaScript is the most widely-used language for adding dynamic behavior to web pages. The JavaScript community contributes to a collection of libraries that extend and ease its use. In this course, you will learn about jQuery https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery, a JavaScript library that makes it easy to add dynamic behavior to HTML elements.

Let’s look at an example of how JavaScript is used to add dynamic behavior to a web page (don’t worry about understanding the code).

const login = document.getElementById('login');
const loginMenu = document.getElementById('loginMenu');

login.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if(loginMenu.style.display === 'none'){
    loginMenu.style.display = 'inline';
  } else {
    loginMenu.style.display = 'none';
  }
});

In this example, JavaScript is used to apply behavior to an HTML element with id login. The behavior allows a user to click a LOGIN button that toggles a login form.

The code below accomplishes the same behavior with jQuery.

$('#login').click(() => {
  $('#loginMenu').toggle()
});

In this example, the same toggle functionality is accomplished using just three lines of code.

Is there anything that jQuery does that JavaScript can’t do?

jQuery Methods
In the last exercise, you used jQuery to cut twelve lines of code down to three.

Let’s use LEGO bricks as an analogy for understanding how jQuery works. With an infinite number of bricks, you could build an entire city — of course, this would take a long time. What if you were given pre-made LEGO buildings, LEGO roads, LEGO parks, etc? You could build a city much faster.

The JavaScript language represents an infinite supply of LEGO bricks — the possibilities are endless but time-consuming. The pre-made LEGO structures are like jQuery methods https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/methods. You can use these methods to add dynamic behavior, such as .hide() https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery/hide, .show() https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery/show, .fadeIn(), .fadeOut() etc., to HTML elements.

The example in the last exercise took twelve lines of JavaScript, but was achieved with only three lines of jQuery’s .click() https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery/click and .toggle() methods.

What jQuery methods should I be familiar with?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/what-jquery-methods-should-i-be-familiar-with/368676?_gl=1*1mvcw5e*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODYxODY0LjAuMC4w

jQuery Library
We are going to use jQuery to add some interactivity to the MOVE Gear site, an online marketplace for athletic apparel.

To use the jQuery library, index.html must load it with the other dependencies. Take a look at the attached diagram to see where various dependencies load in an HTML document.

The document is loaded from top to bottom. So the style dependencies in the <head> will load first, then the structural elements in the <body> will load next. It has become common practice to link the main JavaScript file at the bottom of the HTML document because a good deal of the content of the script will require that the dependencies, style sheets and elements exist before the browser can run the JavaScript that uses and references those things.

When you add the jQuery library to your project in the next exercise, you will do so on the line before the </body> tag. Because HTML files load from top to bottom, adding the jQuery library at the bottom of your project will ensure that it will not affect the HTML (structure) and CSS (style) load times.

What will happen if I put a <script> element in the <head> instead of at the end of the <body>?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/what-will-happen-if-i-put-a-script-element-in-the-head-instead-of-at-the-end-of-the-body/368675?_gl=1*n0mp5g*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODYyNDk2LjAuMC4w

Adding jQuery
To include jQuery, we use a <script> tag as follows:

<script
  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4="
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

In this example, the jQuery library is loaded from the jQuery content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a collection of servers that can deliver content.

You must include the <script> tag in the HTML document before you link to a JavaScript file that uses the jQuery library. The integrity and crossorigin properties in the example ensure the file is delivered without any third-party manipulation.

We will use jQuery methods in a JavaScript file called main.js, which we will load into index.html using a <script> tag. We need to load the jQuery library before the main.js file. Otherwise, the computer will not understand the jQuery used in main.js.

Why should I use a CDN (content delivery network) to include jQuery over downloading the jQuery library to my project?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/why-should-i-use-a-cdn-content-delivery-network-to-include-jquery-over-downloading-the-jquery-library-to-my-project/368673?_gl=1*6dahil*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODYzMDU1LjAuMC4w

.ready()
The jQuery https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery library makes it quick and easy to add visual effects and interactivity to your web page. However, a web page must be rendered in a user’s browser before it’s possible to have any dynamic behavior. To solve this problem, we will use our first jQuery method.

The jQuery .ready() method waits until the HTML page’s DOM is ready to manipulate. You should wrap all JavaScript behavior inside of the .ready() method. This will make sure the web page is rendered in the browser before any jQuery code executes.

$(document).ready(() => {

});

In the example above, the .ready() method waits until the browser finishes rendering the HTML document before triggering a callback function. We will write all of our jQuery behavior inside this callback function.

Do my functions have to be defined in jQuery’s .ready() method?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/do-my-functions-have-to-be-defined-in-jquerys-ready-method/368679?_gl=1*y7k02p*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODYzMTQxLjAuMC4w

Targeting by Class
Let’s look at the code we just pasted into our main.js file:

$(document).ready(() => {
    
});

In the example above, document is a special keyword that we use to target the HTML document and create a jQuery https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery object.

We can use the same $() syntax to create jQuery objects https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/objects for elements on a web page. Typically, we pass a string into $() to target elements by id, class, or tag. Once targeted, we can use . notation to attach a handler method that triggers a callback function.

Let’s consider how we can target elements by class. We can reference elements by class name with the following syntax:

$('.someClass').handlerMethod();

In the example above, every element with a class of 'someClass' is targeted. Note, we prepend the class name with a period (.someClass). Then, we call the .handlerMethod() on all of the referenced items.

Let’s give this a shot on our MOVE Gear site.

When I use the class selector, will I be selecting all elements with that class, or just the first instance of that class?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/when-i-use-the-class-selector-will-i-be-selecting-all-elements-with-that-class-or-just-the-first-instance-of-that-class/368681?_gl=1*ssu5d8*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODYzODY5LjAuMC4w

Targeting by id
While classes allow us to target multiple elements at once, we can also target single elements by id.

To select by id, we prepend the element’s id name with the # symbol.

$('#someId').hide();

In the example above, we target the #someId element and call the .hide() https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery/hide method on it. The .hide() method hides the someId element when the web page renders to a client’s browser.

Let’s target by id to hide the navigation menu in our MOVE Gear site.

Are there other ways I can target elements besides by class and by id?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/are-there-other-ways-i-can-target-elements-besides-by-class-and-by-id/368683?_gl=1*15zafig*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODY0MTU5LjAuMC4w

jQuery Objects
Now that you’ve seen some jQuery https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery in action, let’s dive a bit deeper into syntax. You’ve probably noticed the $ symbol before anything we target. The $ symbol is an alias for the jQuery function. The $ symbol and jQuery are interchangeable.

The jQuery function takes a parameter that targets an element, like '#navMenu', and turns it into a jQuery object. Then, you can call any jQuery method on a jQuery object.

Developers often save jQuery objects https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/objects in variables https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/variables, like so:

const $jQueryObject = $('.someClass');

Notice our variable name, $jQueryObject, starts with the ($) character. It is best practice to name jQuery object variables with a leading $. It is a naming convention that reminds you and lets others know that a given variable is a jQuery object.

With this in mind, let’s improve our code from the previous Exercise.

What’s the difference between a jQuery object and a DOM node?
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/whats-the-difference-between-a-jquery-object-and-a-dom-node/368677?_gl=1*1pmktdb*_ga*NDk3Mzk5MDMyMy4xNjc3Njk2MDE3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcwMTg2MTI0NS41NTkuMS4xNzAxODY1MTcxLjAuMC4w

Event Handlers
Now that we’ve got jQuery up and running, let’s give it a little gas! The jQuery .on() method adds event handlers to jQuery objects https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/objects. The method takes two parameters: a string declaring the event to listen for (the handler) and a callback function to fire when the event is detected.

$('#login').on('click', () => {
  $loginForm.show();
})

In the example above, we use .on() to add the click event handler to the #login element. Inside of the callback function, we use the .show() https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/jquery/show method to show the jQuery object saved in the $loginForm variable.

When a user clicks the login element, the login form appears.

Let’s try it out on our site!

What other event types does the .on() method take (besides ‘click’)?

Review: jQuery Introduction
That’s just a taste of what you can do with jQuery. While there’s still a lot to learn, in this unit you used jQuery to add dynamic behavior to a website. With jQuery objects https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/objects, you can quickly target elements, handle events https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/events and add visual effects with just a few lines of code.

That said, when using any jQuery tools, it is important to consider how events and effects will appear on different platforms.
